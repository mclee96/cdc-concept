			<h3 class="display-4" style="font-size: 30px">Kenny Chan</h3>

			<p>Pastor Kenny (aka 'PK') is our English side's most senior pastor. He has awesome hair and is married to his wife Vanda. They have four kids and have served at our church for almost 20 years or so. Something like that. He used to be able to do one armed pushups and always (man, ALWAYS) helps take out the trash Sundays after lunch. </p>

			<h3 class="display-4" style="font-size: 30px">Joey Wang</h3>

			<p>Pastor Joey (aka 'Joey') is an avid reader of books and, if I was to guess, owns the largest collections of books here at church. Chances are you'll get a book from Joey at some point cause that's just what he likes to give people. He's married to his wife Margaret and they have two awesome little boys. I'm pretty sure that Joey gets a haircut every other day cause his hair is always so short. Joey is currently on Sabbatical, which means he's probably eating lobster or watching a Red Sox game out in Boston. Jk, but he is on sabbatical.</p>

			<h3 class="display-4" style="font-size: 30px">Daniel Chen</h3>

			<p>Pastor Daniel (aka 'D. Chen') is the newest addition to our English side staff! He grew up in the church (so NOBODY says 'Pastor Daniel' cause that's real weird) and recently finished his M.D. at Western Seminary. Since then, he's been helping serve at the church and also leads our youth group. Daniel loves watching movies.</p>
